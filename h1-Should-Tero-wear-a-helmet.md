# h1 - Should Tero wear a helmet?

## Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto

- Threat modeling = analyzing system to uncover vulnerabilities/threats
- Everyone should threat model
- Values: finding and fixing issues, collaboration, continuos refinement
- Principles: improving security&privacy, frequent analysis
  
>	Patterns that benefit threat modeling

  - Systematic approach
  - Creativity
  - Varied Viewpoints
  - Improvement
  - Theory into practice

>	Anti-Pattern to avoid

  - Relying on one person
  - Over-focusing on one problem
  - Aiming for perfect representation

## Shostack 2022: Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course
***What are we working on?***

- Collaboration = teamworking
- Sketching our visual representation because it will be probably imperfect
- Data flow diagrams

***What can go wrong?***

-	STRIDE (Improves threat modeling)
-	Killchain

***What are we going to do about it?***

- Track work
- Risk management

***Did we do a good job?***

- If you can recommend threat modelling then it means you did a good job

***Threats tend to follow data***

## OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021: Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet

- Threat modeling is ideally performed early in the SDLC, such as during the design phase.

> Advantages
  - Identifying Risks early
  - Increased Security
  - Improved Visibility

> Steps
  - System modeling with Flow Diagrams
  - Identify threats with ***STRIDE*** (***S***poofing, ***T***ampering, ***R***epudiation, ***I***nformation Disclosure, ***D***enial of Service, ***E***levation of privileges)
  - Each identified threat should have a response (Mitigate, Eliminate, Transfer, Accept)
  - And finally Review with key questions

> Challenges
  - Team lacks knowledge
  - Complexity & time-consuming
  - Lack of communication/collaboration

***SOLUTION*** = Threat Modeling Sessions & Training
