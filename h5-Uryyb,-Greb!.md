## â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations
**1.1 Terminology**
- ***Sender and receiver:*** the sender's goal is to send a private message securely to the receiver by making sure no one can read the message.
- ***Messages and Encryption:***
  - Message (Plaintext) -> Securing Message (Encryption) -> Encrypted Message (Ciphertext) -> in order to read Message (Decryption)

  - ****Cryptographers*** secure messages whereas ***Cryptoanalysts*** try to decrypt those. (For both: Cryptologists)
  - | Expression  | What it means |
    | ------------- | ------------- |
    | ***E(M) = C*** | The plaintext (M) which is being encrypted (E) equals to the ciphertext (C) |
    | ***D(C) = M*** | The ciphertext (C) which is being decrypted (D) equals to the plaintext (M) |
    | ***D(E(M)) = M*** | Both combined equals to the plaintext since in the end its what is being searched |
- In addtion to confidentiality: ***Authentication, Integrity, and Nonrepudiation***:
  - Authentication: Ensures the origin of the message.
  - Integrity: Ensures the message hasn't been altered.
  - Nonrepudiation: Prevents the sender from denying they sent a message.
- ***Algorithms and Keys***
  - There's two types of cipher (algorithm of encryption/decryption):
    - The first is using the same key for both ends (encryption and decryption) - <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c766a204-036d-4faa-8e09-d9795ba103b1" width="90">

    - The second way is to use different keys (one for encryption and another for decryption) - <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b3681bc-576d-483c-9025-b244775db0ae" width="90">

  - The first can be referred as a Symmetric Algorithm whereas the second one can be referred as Public-Key Algorithm <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5e6e848-8e28-44b3-a638-8daddc421780" width="300">  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68d49d15-b4db-41df-b4f1-4d78ef34101a" width="300">

- ***Cryptanalysis***
  - There are lots of ways to find out the plaintext without access to the key, for example:
    - Ciphertext-Only Attack: trying to deduce the text or key with ciphertext only
    - Known-Plaintext Attack: trying to deduce the key with both ciphertext and plaintext
    - Rubber-Hose Cryptanalysis: ITS THE BEST WAY ;) by forcing, torture or blackmail ðŸ‘€
- ***Security of Algorithms***
  - Unconditionally Secure: Systems like the one-time pad are unbreakable given unlimited resources
  - Computational Security: Most systems aim to be infeasible to break with current computational resources
  - Brute-Force Attacks: Trying all possible keys to decrypt, though computationally expensive, remains a threat
