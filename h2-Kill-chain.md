# Installing VirtualBox and Debian 12-Bookworm Linux on it
## 1) I went to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and clicked and installed "Windows hosts"

## 2) I opened the setup and clicked on "Next >" in order to start the setup procedure

## 3) Again on "Next >" (if you don't want to change Location where its going to be downloaded, otherwise just continue)

## 4) Now on "Yes", this could temporarily disconnect you from the internet but don't worry :)

## 5) Now I clicked on "Yes" because in order the VM to function some packages needed to be installed

## 6) Here I unchecked the creation of an start menu, shortcut on desktop and in the quick launch bar and clicked on "Next >" because I don't like polluting my system with icons. I rather search things in the taskbar :)

## 7) Last but not least I clicked on "Install" to complete the setup

## 8) Finally I unchecked the option to start it right away and clicked on "Finish" because I wanted to install the ISO first and the open the VM
