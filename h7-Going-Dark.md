## Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser â‚¬
***Introduction***
- Tor is a modified version of Firefox
- It hides IP Addresses to surf anonimously
- Easy to use

***History and Intended Use of The Onion Router***
- It was developed to allow private communication for example whistleblowers
- Developed by the US government in 2002
- Mantained by nobody, yet accessible for everybody
- US Government is researching how to deanonymize users

***How The Onion Router Works***
- The users traffic is being redirected to random relays which serve as a layer of encryption
  - Goes through an entry relay then middle relay and lastly through an exit relay and they dont know anything about the traffic route
  - Route changes every 10min
- The data is first encrypted with elliptic curve cryptography which is unbreakable
- Its called Onion because each layer is seen as different relays

***Tracking Criminals Using TOR***
- Tor is difficult to break but users can make mistakes
- Most successes of tracking criminals is because of their own mistakes
- Example: Ross Ulbricht created a marketplace but he did a mistake -> he used his real email and name
